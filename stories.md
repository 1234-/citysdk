## User Stories ##

This project utilizes an agile process to prioritize a set of user stories that will be completed each sprint.  Contributions are welcome from the community on which User Stories would be most impactful to include in the SDK.  User Stories should be written from the perspective of a citizen or "user" that lives in a city and wants to utilize a service.  i.e.  	"As a first-time home buyer, I want to find all kinds of assistance available, through grants, low-cost loans, free counseling or public resource centers, so that I can buy my first home."
