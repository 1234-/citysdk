## What is the City SDK 
1.  CitySDK is a way to facilitate integrating city and federal data.
2.  The ultimate goal of the project is to streamline the creation of open data apps for cities.
3.  US Census Bureau is the first, and lead agency embracing the project. 
4.  The City SDK is a set of open source tools to make developers more productive  when using data from federal, state, and city data sources
5.  Civic leaders act as SMEâ€™s for it and define needs based on city requirements
6.  Ultimately, it will include other federal and local government entities, as well as private industry
7.  Imagine one day being able to use common interfaces between cities, and if cities were able to release similar datasets in similar formats.
