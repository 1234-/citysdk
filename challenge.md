### Coming Soon: Register for the City SDK National Challenge
The U.S. Census Bureau is participating in this year’s National Day of Civic Hacking by launching the “City SDK Open Data Solutions Challenge” for developers to use its new City Software Development Kit (SDK). The features in this kit have been directly informed by developer feedback to make building apps using the Census API easier.
